# Behavior Change Psychology

Suki leverages behavior change principles to build lasting emotional habits gently and sustainably:

## Emotional Reward Loop
The evolving memory pet creates a parasocial bond, offering immediate positive feedback and intrinsic motivation to return.

## Low Effort, High Impact
One-tap logging reduces friction, making habit formation easier compared to traditional journaling or complex trackers.

## Progressive Disclosure
Features unlock gradually, preventing overwhelm and keeping curiosity engaged over time.

## No Punishment for Missed Days
Avoiding streak resets or guilt reduces anxiety, encouraging continued use despite life's ups and downs.

## Ambient Prompts via Widgets
Subtle, ever-present cues nudge users gently without intrusive notifications or pressure.

## Meaningful Reflection
Regular visual recaps and time capsules encourage introspection and reinforce the value of the habit.
