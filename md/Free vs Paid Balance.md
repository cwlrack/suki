# Free vs Paid Balance

Suki's free vs paid balance is crafted to maximize user adoption while ensuring sustainable revenue and continuous product improvement.

## Generous Free Tier
The core experience—including daily one-tap mood logging, the interactive memory pet, photo attachments (limited), basic tags, and standard themes—is fully free and polished. This creates a strong baseline value that lowers barriers and builds trust.

## Premium Features for Added Depth
Advanced capabilities such as unlimited encrypted backups, deep mood and activity correlations, custom themes, voice input, multi-photo uploads, and flexible time capsules are reserved for premium subscribers. This separation ensures free users still receive a complete, meaningful experience while encouraging power users to upgrade.

## No Gating of Polished Essentials
Polish and usability improvements apply equally to free and paid users. Small UI tweaks, animations, and bug fixes are never paywalled, avoiding frustration or perceived nickel-and-diming.

## Psychological Pricing & Transparency
Pricing is clearly communicated, emphasizing how premium features deepen personalization and privacy, rather than restricting core functions. This builds goodwill and reduces churn.

## Optional One-Time Purchases
For users reluctant to subscribe, select premium add-ons (themes, extra photo packs) are available as one-offs, diversifying revenue streams.
