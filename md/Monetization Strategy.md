# Monetization Strategy

Suki adopts a user-friendly, value-driven monetization model designed to sustain ongoing development without compromising the core free experience.

## Free Core Experience
The essential memory companion features—daily mood logging, the interactive pet, basic tagging, photo attachment, and standard themes—are completely free and polished. This lowers the barrier to entry and encourages wide adoption.

## Premium Subscription
A reasonably priced subscription unlocks advanced features and customization options, including:
* Unlimited encrypted backups and cross-device sync
* Deep analytics and emotional correlations
* Custom themes, backgrounds, and expanded photo limits
* Voice input and automatic weather/location logging
* Flexible time capsules and private sharing

## No Ads or Data Selling
Suki commits to a strict no-ad policy and no selling user data, building trust and long-term user loyalty.

## One-Time Purchases & Bundles *(Optional)*
Offer select premium features or theme packs as one-time purchases for users who prefer not to subscribe.

## Transparent Value Communication
Clearly communicate what users gain by upgrading, emphasizing personalization, privacy, and meaningful insights rather than gating core functionality.
