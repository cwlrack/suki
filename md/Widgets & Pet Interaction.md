# Widgets & Pet Interaction

Suki's widgets and pet interactions create an ambient, always-present connection that encourages gentle, consistent engagement without demanding attention.

## Home Screen Widgets
Users can place widgets on their device's home screen that show the current mood pet, recent moods, or quick-tap mood logging optionsâ€”making it effortless to check in throughout the day.

## Interactive Pet
The pet responds dynamically to mood inputs and time of day: it might sleep at night, change colors with mood shifts, or react to photos and tags added, giving life and personality to the app's core.

## Ambient Presence
Widgets and pet animations keep Suki subtly in users' awareness, prompting reflection without notifications or intrusive reminders.

## Customization
Widgets support theme and size customization, fitting the user's style and device layout preferences.
