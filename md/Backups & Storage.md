# Backups & Storage

Ensuring users' memories are safe, accessible, and easy to manage is critical. Suki implements robust backup and storage solutions tailored to different user needs.

## Local Storage (Default)
By default, all data—moods, photos, tags, pet state—is stored locally on the device to guarantee privacy and offline access.

## Encrypted Cloud Backups *(Premium Feature)*
Premium users can opt-in to encrypted cloud backups, allowing seamless restoration after device loss or switching devices without risking privacy.

## Multiple Backup Versions
Users can maintain multiple backup snapshots to prevent accidental loss or overwriting, offering peace of mind and version control.

## Backup Export & Import
Users can export their data manually in standard formats for personal archiving or migration, and import backups as needed.

## Storage Management Tools
Built-in tools help users monitor and manage storage usage, especially regarding photo attachments, to prevent app bloat.
