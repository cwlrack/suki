# Time Capsules (Detailed)

Time Capsules are a unique, emotionally engaging feature that lets users lock away memories or entries to be unlocked at a future date—adding anticipation and deeper reflection to the memory-keeping experience.

## User-Created Capsules
Users select specific entries, photos, or tags and place them into a time capsule that remains hidden until the chosen unlock date.

## Unlock Intervals
Capsules can be set to unlock after days, weeks, months, or even years, allowing users to revisit forgotten moments with fresh eyes.

## Free & Premium Tiers
Basic time capsule functionality is available for short-term unlocks (e.g., up to one year). Longer-term or multiple capsules unlock with the premium subscription.

## Emotional Impact
Time capsules create emotional anticipation and surprise, making memory reflection feel special rather than routine.

## Seamless Integration
Capsules integrate with the memory pet and app themes—unlocking can trigger visual or behavioral changes in the pet to mark the occasion.
