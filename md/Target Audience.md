# Target Audience

Suki is designed for people who want to remember their lives more vividly but are turned off by traditional journaling or mood-tracking apps. Its core audience includes:

## Non-Journalers Seeking Memory Keeping
Individuals who don't keep journals because writing feels like a chore, yet wish they had a simple way to preserve everyday moments and emotions. Suki offers a low-effort, emotionally engaging alternative.

## Emotionally Self-Aware Users Without Clinical Needs
People interested in tracking moods and feelings for self-awareness or personal growth—but not seeking therapy-grade tools. They want something friendly, approachable, and personal rather than clinical or data-heavy.

## Casual Users Curious About Patterns
Users who want to see simple, meaningful patterns in their lives over time—like how weather affects mood or which activities bring joy—but without complex data entry or analysis.

## People Who Value Visual & Emotional Connection
Those drawn to apps that feel warm, alive, and personal rather than cold or technical. Users who respond well to visual storytelling, playful elements (like the memory pet), and emotional feedback.

## Privacy-Conscious Users
Individuals who want to keep their memories private, stored locally or encrypted, and selectively share without fear of data misuse or advertising.
