# Onboarding & User Flow

The onboarding experience in Suki is designed to be seamless, intuitive, and encouraging—minimizing friction while inviting users into a gentle, emotionally rewarding habit.

## Welcome & Introduction
Users are greeted with a warm, simple introduction that explains Suki's purpose: caring for a personal memory companion that grows with them. The tone is calm and inviting, avoiding overwhelm or jargon.

## First Interaction: Meet Your Memory Pet
Users immediately interact with the pet or visual representation, establishing an emotional connection. The pet responds positively to simple input, providing early "moments of magic" that spark curiosity.

## Mood Logging Made Easy
Users tap a mood icon or emoji reflecting how they feel. The UI is clean and playful, emphasizing ease over detail.

## Adding Context: Photos & Tags
Users are encouraged (but never required) to add a photo or select tags that describe activities, people, or places. These inputs feel natural extensions, not burdensome tasks.

## Quick Tips & Mini-Tutorials
Throughout the first week, gentle tips appear to highlight features like voice input, widgets, or time capsules—always optional and contextual.

## First Recap & Encouragement
After about 7 days, users receive a simple reflection showing their pet's growth or a visual "memory constellation," reinforcing the value of their efforts.

## Progressive Feature Unlocks
As users engage more, additional features like custom themes or advanced insights become available, encouraging exploration without overwhelming new users.
