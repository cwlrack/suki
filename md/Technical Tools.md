# Technical Tools

Suki's development leverages modern, efficient tools and workflows that support rapid iteration and high-quality code management.

## Git for Version Control
Git is used to track all code changes, manage branches for features and bug fixes, and facilitate collaboration. This ensures robust version history, easy rollback, and controlled feature releases.

## GitHub as Remote Repository
GitHub hosts the repository, enabling issue tracking, pull requests, code reviews, and integration with CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.

## GitHub Copilot Integration
Copilot accelerates development by suggesting code snippets, functions, and patterns based on natural language prompts, especially helpful for repetitive tasks or boilerplate code.

## Local Development with VS Code
VS Code offers a flexible, powerful IDE supporting debugging, linting, Git integration, and Copilotâ€”making it ideal for coding before building and testing in Android Studio (for Android) or Xcode (for iOS).

## CI/CD & Testing
Automated workflows ensure code quality and streamline deployment, catching regressions early.
