# Gamification Elements

Suki incorporates subtle gamification to encourage daily engagement and build an emotional habit without turning the experience into a chore or competition.

## Living Memory Pet
The pet visually reflects your emotional inputs—its mood, growth, and environment evolve based on your logged moods and activities. This creates a parasocial connection, making users care for the pet as an extension of themselves.

## Progress & Growth Feedback
Users see the pet change shape, colors, or behavior over time, providing tangible, meaningful feedback on their emotional journey rather than abstract stats.

## Unlockables & Milestones
As users log consistently, they unlock new pet accessories, backgrounds, or visual themes. These rewards serve as gentle encouragement rather than pressure.

## Time Capsules & Surprises
Scheduled unlocks of past memories or "time capsules" add an element of anticipation and delight, reinforcing long-term engagement.

## Ambient Animations & Reactions
Subtle animations—like the pet sleeping at night or reacting to moods—make the app feel alive and encourage users to check in regularly to see how their companion is doing.
