# Automatic Weather & Location Integration

Suki can automatically log weather and location data to enrich entries and provide meaningful correlations, like mood changes tied to the weather or places visited.

## Core Philosophy and Value Proposition

The Automatic Weather & Location Integration feature transforms Suki from a simple mood tracker into a comprehensive environmental emotional intelligence system. By seamlessly capturing the physical and environmental context of emotional moments, Suki enables users to discover profound connections between their inner emotional landscape and the external world around them.

This feature operates on several key principles:
- **Ambient data collection** - Capturing contextual information without user effort or interruption
