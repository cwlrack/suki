# Photo & Media Support

Users can attach photos to their daily entriesâ€”capturing moments visually to complement mood logs. The pet's environment can visually reflect these photos, weaving memories into a cohesive, living story.

## Core Functionality

The photo and media support feature enables users to:
- Attach one or more photos per day to enrich their entries with visual memories
- Capture moments beyond words, adding visual depth to mood logging
- See their pet's environment dynamically change to reflect attached photos
- Create a cohesive, living story that weaves memories together visually

## Visual Integration with Pet Environment

One of the most unique aspects of Suki's photo support is how photos directly influence the memory pet's environment:
- Photos become part of the pet's world, appearing as backgrounds, decorations, or environmental elements
- The pet's surroundings evolve to reflect the visual memories captured
- This creates a living, breathing representation of the user's life through their companion
- Visual memories are woven into a cohesive narrative rather than stored as separate files
