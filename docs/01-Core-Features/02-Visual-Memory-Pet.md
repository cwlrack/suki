# Visual Memory Pet

The app presents a living "pet" or character that reflects the user's emotional life. This pet grows, changes, and interacts based on logged moods and activities, creating a subtle, emotional connection that motivates continued use.

## Core Concept and Philosophy

The Visual Memory Pet represents the heart of Suki's emotional design philosophy. Rather than presenting users with cold data visualizations or clinical mood charts, Suki transforms emotional tracking into a warm, living relationship with a digital companion. This pet serves as:

- **An emotional mirror** - Reflecting the user's inner emotional landscape through visual representation
- **A motivation catalyst** - Creating intrinsic motivation to engage with the app through care and nurturing
- **A memory vessel** - Embodying the user's experiences and growth over time
- **A narrative device** - Turning mundane mood tracking into an evolving story

## Design and Visual Philosophy

### Living, Breathing Companion
The memory pet is designed to feel genuinely alive through:
- **Subtle animations** - Breathing, blinking, and micro-movements that create a sense of life
- **Responsive behaviors** - Immediate reactions to user inputs and interactions
- **Autonomous activities** - The pet continues to "live" even when the app is closed, with new behaviors to discover upon return
- **Emotional authenticity** - Visual expressions that genuinely reflect the complexity of human emotions

### Visual Evolution System
The pet's appearance evolves based on:
- **Mood patterns** - Colors, postures, and expressions shift to reflect emotional trends
- **Activity correlations** - Physical appearance adapts to reflect the user's lifestyle and activities
- **Seasonal changes** - Environment and pet characteristics change with real-world seasons
