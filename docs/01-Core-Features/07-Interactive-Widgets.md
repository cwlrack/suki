# Interactive Widgets

Home screen widgets provide quick logging and display the pet and recent moods. Widgets keep the app present in the user's daily life with minimal effort.

## Core Philosophy and Ambient Design

Interactive Widgets represent Suki's commitment to ambient emotional awarenessâ€”making mood tracking and pet interaction as natural and effortless as checking the time. Rather than requiring users to remember to open an app, widgets integrate emotional awareness directly into the user's daily device interaction patterns, creating gentle, persistent touchpoints that support habit formation without creating pressure or interruption.

The widget system operates on key principles:
- **Ambient presence without intrusion** - Maintaining visibility while respecting user attention and focus
- **Instant emotional capture** - Reducing mood logging to a single tap from the home screen
- **Living companion visibility** - Keeping the memory pet present as a constant emotional companion
- **Contextual adaptation** - Widgets that respond intelligently to time of day, usage patterns, and emotional needs
