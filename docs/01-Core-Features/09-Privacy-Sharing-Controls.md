# Privacy & Sharing Controls

Suki respects user privacy with local-first storage and optional encrypted backups. Users can share select memories or summaries privately with trusted friends or therapists.

## Privacy-First Philosophy and Ethical Foundation

Suki's approach to privacy fundamentally differs from the data-harvesting model common in the tech industry. Recognizing that emotional and personal memory data represents some of the most intimate and sensitive information a person can share, Suki operates on an ethical foundation that prioritizes user autonomy, data sovereignty, and genuine privacy protection over business model convenience or data monetization opportunities.

The privacy philosophy operates on core principles:
- **User data sovereignty** - Complete user ownership and control over all emotional and personal data
- **Local-first architecture** - Primary data storage and processing on user devices rather than corporate servers
- **Transparent data practices** - Clear, honest communication about all data collection, processing, and sharing
- **Minimal data collection** - Collecting only information essential for app functionality, never for secondary monetization
- **Voluntary sharing** - All data sharing is explicit, intentional, and revocable by users

## Technical Privacy Architecture

### Local-First Data Storage and Processing
Suki's technical architecture prioritizes local data storage and processing to minimize privacy risks:

**Device-Based Primary Storage**
- All core emotional data (mood logs, photos, tags, pet state) stored locally on user's device using native encryption
- SQLite database implementation with full encryption at rest using platform-provided security frameworks
- Photo and media storage in device-local secure containers with encrypted file system integration
- Backup and sync functionality designed as optional enhancement rather than core dependency

**Local Analytics and Pattern Recognition**
- All mood pattern analysis, correlation detection, and insight generation performed locally on user device
- Machine learning algorithms optimized for local processing without cloud dependency
- Personal emotional intelligence development tracking occurs entirely within user's device ecosystem
- Advanced analytics capabilities that function completely offline and independent of external services

**Offline-First Functionality**
- Complete app functionality available without internet connection or external service dependencies
- Local data synchronization between user's multiple devices without third-party service intermediation
- Backup and restore capabilities that work through direct device-to-device transfer or user-controlled cloud storage
- Emergency data export functionality ensuring user access to personal data regardless of app availability

### Optional Cloud Services with Zero-Knowledge Architecture
For users who choose cloud features, Suki implements industry-leading privacy protection:
