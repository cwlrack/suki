# Behavior Change Psychology

Suki leverages evidence-based behavior change principles to build lasting emotional habits gently and sustainably, creating intrinsic motivation for emotional development rather than external compliance.

## Behavior Change Philosophy and Scientific Foundation

**Core Psychological Principles:**
- **Self-Determination Theory integration** - Supporting autonomy, competence, and relatedness for intrinsic motivation
- **Positive psychology foundation** - Building on strengths and positive emotional experiences rather than deficit-focused approaches
