# Backups & Storage

Ensuring users' memories are safe, accessible, and easy to manage is critical. Suki implements robust backup and storage solutions that prioritize privacy, reliability, and user control.

## Storage Philosophy and Principles

Suki's approach to data storage fundamentally prioritizes user sovereignty, emotional data security, and seamless access across user's chosen devices.

**Core Storage Principles:**
- **User data ownership** - Users maintain complete control and ownership of their emotional data
- **Privacy-first design** - All storage solutions designed with privacy as the primary consideration
- **Reliability and durability** - Multiple layers of protection against data loss
- **Seamless accessibility** - Data available when and where users need it, respecting their privacy choices

**Data Sovereignty Framework:**
- **Local-first storage** - Primary data storage on user's device under their complete control
- **Optional cloud enhancement** - Cloud storage only when user explicitly chooses, with user-controlled encryption
- **Export freedom** - Complete data export in open formats, ensuring no vendor lock-in
- **Deletion rights** - Comprehensive data deletion capabilities respecting user autonomy

## Local Storage Architecture

Comprehensive on-device storage system that ensures privacy, performance, and reliability without cloud dependency.

### Device-First Data Management
Advanced local storage that provides full functionality offline:

**Local Database Architecture:**
- **Encrypted SQLite database** - Core emotional data stored in encrypted, structured database
- **File system integration** - Photos, voice recordings, and media stored securely in encrypted file system
- **Efficient indexing** - Fast search and retrieval of emotional data across years of memories
- **Automatic data integrity** - Regular verification and repair of local data to prevent corruption

**Privacy-First Local Storage:**
- **Hardware-level encryption** - All emotional data encrypted using device's secure enclave and hardware security
- **Keychain integration** - Encryption keys managed through platform keychain services (iOS Keychain, Android Keystore)
- **Secure data wiping** - Complete, secure deletion of emotional data when user chooses to remove it
- **App sandbox security** - Local data protected by platform app sandboxing and security features

### Storage Optimization and Management
Intelligent storage management that respects device resources while preserving emotional memories:

**Efficient Storage Usage:**
- **Smart compression** - Intelligent compression of photos and media that preserves emotional significance while reducing storage impact
- **Selective storage** - User control over which data is stored locally vs. cloud, with intelligent recommendations
- **Storage analytics** - Clear visibility into storage usage by data type (photos, voice, text, insights)
- **Cleanup assistance** - Intelligent suggestions for storage optimization without losing meaningful memories

**Performance Optimization:**
- **Lazy loading** - Efficient loading of emotional data to minimize memory usage and improve app responsiveness
- **Background optimization** - Storage cleanup and optimization during app idle time

## Cloud Backup Services

Optional, user-controlled cloud backup that enhances accessibility while maintaining privacy and security.

### Privacy-Preserving Cloud Architecture
Cloud backup design that ensures user privacy while providing convenience and security:

**Zero-Knowledge Cloud Storage:**
- **Client-side encryption** - All data encrypted on device before transmission to cloud
- **User-controlled keys** - Encryption keys generated and controlled by user, never accessible to Suki or cloud providers
- **Anonymous cloud storage** - Cloud storage that cannot identify users or access their emotional data
- **Encrypted metadata** - Even file metadata and structure encrypted to prevent data inference

**Selective Cloud Sync:**
- **Granular sync control** - Users choose exactly which data types sync to cloud (photos, text, voice, insights)
- **Selective device sync** - Different sync settings for different devices (work phone, personal tablet, etc.)
- **Temporary cloud storage** - Option for temporary cloud storage during device transitions
- **Offline-first operation** - Cloud sync enhances but never replaces local storage capabilities

### Multi-Platform Cloud Integration
Cloud backup that works seamlessly across different platforms while respecting platform-specific security features:

**Cross-Platform Sync:**
- **Universal data format** - Emotional data stored in format that works across iOS, Android, and future platforms
- **Conflict resolution** - Intelligent merging of emotional data when same memories edited on multiple devices
- **Version synchronization** - Maintaining consistent app feature compatibility across devices with different app versions
- **Platform-specific optimization** - Cloud sync optimized for each platform's network and battery characteristics

**Cloud Provider Integration:**
- **Multiple provider support** - Support for user's preferred cloud provider (iCloud, Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.)
- **Provider encryption** - Additional encryption layer on top of provider's existing security
- **Provider independence** - Ability to switch cloud providers without data loss or conversion complexity
- **Hybrid cloud options** - Combination of multiple cloud providers for enhanced reliability and user preference

## Backup Versioning and History

Comprehensive backup history that protects against accidental loss while respecting storage efficiency.

### Intelligent Backup Versioning
Backup system that balances comprehensive protection with storage efficiency:

**Smart Backup Scheduling:**
- **Incremental backups** - Only changes since last backup are stored, minimizing storage and transfer requirements
- **Milestone backups** - Complete backups at significant emotional development milestones
- **User-triggered backups** - Manual backup creation before major life transitions or important emotional processing
- **Automatic backup triggers** - Intelligent backup timing based on emotional data volume and significance

**Version Management:**
- **Configurable retention** - User control over how many backup versions to maintain
- **Intelligent version pruning** - Automatic cleanup of older backups while preserving emotionally significant versions
- **Backup verification** - Regular verification that backups are complete and restorable
- **Storage impact transparency** - Clear information about backup storage usage and costs
