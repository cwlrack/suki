# Technical Architecture

Suki's technical architecture prioritizes privacy, emotional authenticity, and scalable performance while maintaining the intimate, personal nature of emotional data.

## Privacy-First Architecture Philosophy

Every architectural decision in Suki prioritizes user privacy and data sovereignty, ensuring emotional data remains secure and under user control.

**Core Privacy Principles:**
- **Local-first data processing** - Emotional analysis and insights generated on-device whenever possible
- **Minimal data transmission** - Only essential data leaves the user's device, and only when necessary for specific features

- **Zero-trust security model** - All data transmission and storage designed with assumption of hostile network environments

**Privacy-by-Design Implementation:**
- **Encrypted local storage** - All on-device emotional data encrypted using device hardware security
- **Anonymous cloud analytics** - Any aggregate data for app improvement is completely anonymized and aggregated
- **Selective cloud sync** - Users choose exactly which data (if any) syncs across devices
- **Regulatory compliance** - Full GDPR, CCPA, and international privacy regulation compliance built into architecture
